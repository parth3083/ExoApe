This is a React.js-based website inspired by the captivating design and animations of Exoape's homepage. Through this project, I've aimed to recreate the visual and interactive experience of Exoape's website while leveraging modern web development tools and libraries.
<br/>
<br/>
Key Features:
<br/>
Cloned Homepage: The project includes a cloned version of Exoape's homepage, featuring similar layout, design elements, and animations.
<br/>
React.js Implementation: The user interface (UI) of this project is built entirely using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
<br/>
Scrolling Effects with Locomotive Scroll: To achieve smooth scrolling behavior, I've utilized Locomotive Scroll v5 beta. This library enhances the scrolling experience by providing a customizable, high-performance scroll engine.
<br/>
Animations with GSAP and Framer Motion: The project integrates GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) along with Framer Motion for creating captivating animations throughout the website. These libraries enable fluid and dynamic transitions, enhancing user engagement.
